<h2>My resume</h2>
                        <p>I recently started working at a wedding venue called Siepmre, and I absolutely love it. As a hostess, I've had the opportunity to be part of the special moments that make weddings so memorable. My role involves welcoming guests, ensuring they have everything they need, and helping to create a warm and inviting atmosphere. Despite being relatively new to the job, I've already formed a deep appreciation for the joy and excitement that comes with each event. Working at Siepmre has been a rewarding experience, and I look forward to continuing to be part of these beautiful celebrations.</p>
                        <p>As a private tennis coach, I have the privilege of working closely with my students to improve their skills and passion for the game. Each session is tailored to the individual, focusing on technique, strategy, and overall game improvement. I provide personalized feedback and guidance to help my students reach their full potential and achieve their tennis goals. Whether I'm teaching beginners the basics or refining the skills of more advanced players, seeing my students' progress and love for the sport grow is incredibly rewarding. My job allows me to share my passion for tennis and help others develop their skills, which is truly fulfilling.</p>
                        <p>As a mobile beverage caterer, I specialize in providing on-the-go drink services, reminiscent of a portable soda fountain. My role involves crafting bespoke beverages tailored to each client's preferences, utilizing a diverse range of flavors and ingredients. Whether it's a classic soda, an innovative concoction, or a refreshing mocktail, I take pride in creating memorable and flavorful drinks that elevate events and gatherings. My dedication to quality and creativity ensures that each beverage is a delightful and unique experience for every guest.</p>
                        <p>I graduated from Corner Canyon High School and am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree at Brigham Young University. I am studying with the goal of majoring in Experience Design and Management (EXDM). This field combines my interests in creativity, problem-solving, and creating meaningful experiences for others. I am excited about the opportunities ahead and eager to apply what I learn to make a positive impact in the world of experience design.</p>
                       
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How it all started</h2>
                        <p>My love for pickleball began when my boyfriend and I discovered the sport together. We instantly bonded over the fast-paced nature of the game and the fun we had playing together. As we spent more time on the court, our skills improved, and so did our love for the game. Now, pickleball has become a regular part of our lives, and we play whenever we can. The sport has not only brought us closer together but has also provided us with countless memorable moments and shared experiences.</p>
